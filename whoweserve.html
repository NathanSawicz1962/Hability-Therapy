    <h1>Who We Serve</h1>

    <img src="occupational image 14.jpg" alt="Occupational therapy" class="logo">
    
    <p>
        Occupational therapy serves as a vital bridge for anyone whose daily rhythm has been interrupted, whether by a lifelong developmental condition, a sudden physical injury, or the natural challenges of aging. We work with a vast community of individualsfrom students needing help with fine motor skills for school to professionals adapting their workspace after a neurological event. The goal is always to transform "I can't" into "I can" by adapting the environment and teaching new ways to master essential life skills.</p> <br>

<p>At Hability Therapy, we recognize that a person’s identity is just as important as their physical health, which is why our practice is built on a foundation of radical inclusivity. We purposefully serve every race, gender, and disability, understanding that healthcare is never one-size-fits-all. By honoring the specific cultural and personal backgrounds of our clients, we ensure that our treatment plans are not only clinically sound but also deeply respectful of the lived experiences each individual brings through our doors.</p><br>

<p>We are dedicated to removing the social and systemic barriers that often make it difficult for marginalized groups to find high-quality rehabilitative care. Our clinic is a space where diversity is the standard, not the exception, and where people of all gender identities and racial backgrounds can find practitioners who truly listen to them. We believe that by creating an environment free of judgment and bias, we allow our clients to focus entirely on their growth and functional independence.
